Created a MovieDB Application with optimized searching features once cell is selected/tapped up a different view for the user to see more information about the applicaiton.
Using this application required using get methods from iOS get UrlSession as well using as using Search Controlller Delegate. I'm looking forward to creating more application as well as editing this exisitng o
I think what makes this application code speical to me is and recognizing there's so many different ways to pass data. In my application I display two ways to pass the decoded json informaiton to one using protocols and delegates and the using escaping closures.
